#opentable - task

The application is created with vue cli 3.

In this task, i tried to cover as much as i could in given time. I wish I had more time to complete it all.
Some of the main features of the web app are: 
* design ui (the design is subjective. I'm happy to change it if it's not allying)
* a web app that you can see the json menu into three categories. 
* I used three stock images to display the 3 different types of dishes.
* I created web responsive design
* CSS styles and animation
* Basket feature for adding the dishes and show the total price by clicking on it.
* Calculation of the total price and counter for the selected dishes
* Reusable componets (eg. menuList, navbar, footer, inner methods)

# If i had more time
i would create methods for controlling the user interaction regarding the #rules (restrictions). 
For example, the order can't be done with less than 2 courses for one meal(1person). Create method that restricts the action to proceed while you click order and show (error) notification to the user.

In case of the cheesecake, a filter condition for cheescake<=1 is allowed and show notification to the user.
Also, the same for the Pierre the snobby waiter and his dishes. A filter condition for the prawn cocktail and salmon must be != with meal.

Moreover, if i had some more time i would, 
* create section with the summary of the order showing in details what he ordered.  
* add animation while the user clicks the add to basket button.
* better ui and ux design

# Future scale 
* I would converted from static json to api restful data
* more pages for user interaction such as details for each dish, dish of day, chef suggestion etc.
* meal recomendation regarding the choice of the user
* meal combination (one click to order)
* payment system
* user data confirmation
* reviews for each dish

Please I'm happy to answer to you if you have any question. 

Thank you for your time.
